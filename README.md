this is Ismail Aydin Karayilan's personal branch.

Here are my tasks which are done all by me:
  1. Creating appropriate database for demo of our application.
  2. Creating Cabin Crew API
  3. Creating Flight Crew API
  4. Creating a login mechanism. (This part is in Cem Görkem Baysal's branch due to the decision of having login inside Flight API)

Here are the tasks I contributed and helped:
  1. Creating Passanger API (We worked with Ege Diriöz together to create it. It was a %50-%50 work)
  2. Implementing basic structure for Flight API (It has builded on to my methods in Cabin Crew API)
